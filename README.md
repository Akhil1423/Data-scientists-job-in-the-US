**DATA SCIENTIST JOB MARKET IN USA**

**Introduction:**
The “Data Scientist Job Market in USA” is the main idea of this project. The idea is about how the job market was and how could be the outputs from the market in USA in particular year. Now, we can find many job searching options around the world, but by using this project we can provide an easy access for the recently graduated individuals. Using this idea with the help of ML algorithms, we can find the desire results with the effective graphical representation includes histograms, charts, bar graph etc. The person also gets the information about the company and their overview details with an ease. 

**Statement of the Project Problem:**
Before this, many people using various options for searching jobs, it’s been difficult by going through all this process. The individual requires a lot of time in searching the precise job role at particular location. By using this project, they can easily find the information about the desire job designation with required location, and they can get more information about the company.

**Objective of the Study:**
The main objective of this project is to perform the confusion matrix of SGD classification, accuracy with Support Vector Machine algorithm and XGBOOST, accuracy with Naïve bayes algorithms.

**Research Analysis:**
In this I’ve performed the data visualizations using the algorithms.
Here, I’ve found the relation between no of jobs based on company. No of positions vs Company name, no of roles vs most wanted job role. Only these three visualizations are performed for dataset. With the help of confusion matrix of SVM classifications, Naïve Bayes, XGBOOST, SGD etc. I’ve concluded the accuracy with the precise output.

**About the Dataset:** 
The dataset explains about the various aspect of the job roles in different locations throughout the USA in a particular year. Based on the company, roles, locations, and their working leaders or the management we can derive the analysis according to our assumption. In this I’ve found the various data analysis points so that I can be able to perform the machine learning operations by using the code and some specific software tools. This dataset consists of 5 rows and around 6000 columns with variety of attributes in it.

**Conclusion:**
By using the machine learning algorithm like SVM, Naïve Bayes, SGD confusion matrix I’ve performed the operations and concluded that among four classification Naïve Bayes has the least accuracy and XGBOOST is the highest with 0.7957813998082455 accuracy. By adopting this project, we can get the desire outcomes in searching for the information about the Data scientist job roles or any other related details about the company, designation, location etc. The resultant output is effective with precise data.

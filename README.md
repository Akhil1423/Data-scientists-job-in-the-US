# Data-scientists-job-in-the-US
The “Data Scientist Job Market in USA” is the dataset which I’ve selected as a part of my research. The dataset explains about the various aspect of the job roles in different locations throughout the USA in a particular year. Based on the company, roles, locations, and their working leaders or the management we can derive the analysis according to our assumption. In this I’ve found the various data analysis points so that I can be able to perform the machine learning operations by using the code and some specific software tools. This dataset consists of various rows and columns with variety of attributes in it. 
The main reason for choosing this project is to overcome the desired output using the plots, Graphs, histograms, etc. In the recent time I’ve worked with the Kaggle datasets which are appropriate but contains some missing values. After performing the tasks like data cleaning, data visualization, data handling those errors can be corrected. We can come across the required results at the end. By analyzing, all this views to conclude the selected query is effective dataset.
